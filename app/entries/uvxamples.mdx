### Getting started with libuv API

[Libuv](https://libuv.org/) is a C library for asynchronous I/O.
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) uses libuv as its event loop implementation and
all async systems operations and system calls like file creation, socket
creations, threads creation and so on.

I wrote some examples using libuv. Just for you ðŸ©µ
