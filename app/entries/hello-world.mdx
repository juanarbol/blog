Hello world!

My name is Juan, and this blog will be the space I will use to document my
Open Source journey, probably some readings, cooking recipes, everything that I
am interested in.

For now, it is a quite simple Next.js and tailwind CSS website, that will be
evolving and supporting more complexity with time (or even rethinking it).

Please stay tuned! I have plans to publish very quite weird things!

You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/soyjuanarbol) for further
