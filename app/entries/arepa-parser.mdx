### My personal and experimental HTTP parser library written in C

I'm my C learning journey I decided to bisect a whole HTTP request;
I began creating a TCP server, create the socket, accept connections, write into
client's sockets... That went really well, then I realized that a HTTP server is
more complicated than that, it needs a parser.

I took that innertia and wrote my own HTTP parser in C.
